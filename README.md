# externa v0.0.1

## What is it?
externa.js simplifies communication across the boundary between windows (parent and iframe, for example) and between windows and web workers.

## Why Would I Use It?
Well, I'd wait until it his v1.0.0 before you do. Right now it's a diamond in the rough (at best). More to come in the near future....
