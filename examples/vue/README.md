# externa-vue-example

## Explanation
This is a rough proof-of-concept example app showing _very_ basic usage of externa. It will likely not live long in the repo, as I plan for example apps to reside in a separate + dedicated repo.

After installing dependencies, etc., run `npm run serve` in this directory and then load [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/) in your browser. Watch the browser console for log messages (optional: you can also enable logging via the debug module by setting the `debug` flag in `localStorage` to `externa*`).
